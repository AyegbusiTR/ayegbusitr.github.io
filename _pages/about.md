I am a final year Cognitive Science Ph.D. student at the [School of Collective Intelligence](https://sci.um6p.ma/), University Mohammed VI Polytechnic, Morocco (UM6P), and Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris (Cotutelle) under the mentorship of a great cognitive scientist, Professor [Brent Strickland](http://www.brentstrickland.net/) (IJN, ENS-PSL) and computer scientist, Professor [Mark Klein](https://deliberatorium.org/homepage/index.html) (MIT). I am currently in the process of defending my thesis. My background was in mathematics - I hold a Bachelor and Master degrees in mathematics from the [University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa](https://www.ukzn.ac.za) (UKZN) and [Ekiti State University](https://www.eksu.edu.ng), Nigeria, respectively, where I graduated with Distinctions. 

My research investigates the spread of bias (notably myside bias/confirmation bias) and misinformation within groups. My goal is to identify ways to improve the spread of accurate information while concurrently reducing the dissemination of misinformation and interested in interventions at both the individual and group levels. 

In one line of my work, I found observers judge group members who are pessimistic about the group's future as less loyal to the organization relative to members who are optimistic. Inferences of disloyalty persist even when observers think that pessimism is more accurate, and when the individual aligns with the (pessimistic) majority  (Lukumon, G., Cusimano, C., & Strickland, B., in prep.). 

In my other line of work, I investigated the impact of confirmation bias (myside bias) that may distort multiple steps of accumulating scientific knowledge (Lukumon, G; Picat, L; Chemla, E; & Strickland, B [under review] Cognitive Science). 

In another line, I found misinformation could be reduced through "adversarial collaboration" among fact-checkers (Lukumon, G; Bryd N; & Strickland B, in prep.). 

In [(Lukumon G; and Klein M, 2023)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40622-023-00349-w), I examined types of information people are best at spotting (good vs. bad) and a technique meant to assist collective innovation called "crowd-based" idea filtering and the effect of token budget sizes. 

Also, in the past, I researched ways to improve math education and to improve students’ and teachers’ attitudes towards math ([Lukumon, G., & Maharaj, A., 2022](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/18117295.2022.2075173); [Maharaj, A; and Lukumon G., 2021] (https://www.kansaiuniversityreports.com/article/commerce-students-ability-to-correctly-apply-integration-rules)). 

Apart from my academic pursuits, I have demonstrated a capacity to effectively mentor and lead others. For instance, I am the founder of the [Hotspot International Scholars Forum](https://www.hotspotisf.com) (HISF, formerly International Scholarship Forum). I initiated this project to provide students with scholarship information and mentorship, all free of charge. At present, the initiative boasts nearly 5000 members in the WhatsApp groups, over 20,000 followers on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/forum_isf), and a [repository](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1UVI5yT-5JfMwyHHloxPwkuuPm08L_zBn) of over a thousand scholarship resources on the shared drive. 

I also founded ["Math with Lukgaf"](https://www.youtube.com/@mathwithLukgaf) - an online free mathematics resources in Yoruba.  Recognizing the challenges that African students encounter in STEM, I embarked on demystifying mathematics and sciences in Yoruba — an indigenous language spoken by inhabitants of West African countries such as Nigeria, Benin Republic, Togo, and parts of Sierra Leone. Through this initiative, I have successfully produced more than 400 videos (see [here](https://www.youtube.com/@mathwithLukgaf) for some of my resources). They are available in some community libraries  and also Radio and TV stations featured them. This year, I was honored to receive the UKZN Inspiring Impact Award, recognizing my initiative as a social enterprise making a substantial impact in people's lives. Students consistently report that I am one of their best mentors and teachers.
